While “precisely” is not very scientific, we can at least test for whether there appears to be a discrete jump in the running variable around the threshold. Evidence of such a jump may suggest that manipulation is present. Provide the results from the manipulation tests described in Cattaneo, Jansson, and Ma (2018). This test can be implemented with the rddensity package in R, Stata, or Python."
