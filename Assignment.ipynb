    "##### 3. Calonico, Cattaneo, and Titiunik (2015) discuss the appropriate partition size for binned scatterplots such as that in Figure 3 of Ericson (2014). More formally, denote by $\\mathbb{P}_{-,n} = \\{P_{-,j} : j = 1, 2, ...J_{-,n}\\}$ and $\\mathbb{P_{+,n}} = \\{P_{+,j} : j = 1, 2, ...J_{+,n}\\}$ the partitions of the support of the running variable $x_i$ on the left and right (respectively) of the cutoff, $\\bar{x}$. $P_{-,j}$ and $P_{+,n}$ denote the actual supports for each $j$ partition of size $J_{-,n}$ and $J_{+,n}$ such that $[x_l, \\bar{x}) = \\cup_{j=1}^{J_{-.n}} P_{-,j}$ and $(\\bar{x}, x_u] = \\cup_{j=1}^{J_{+,n}} P_{+,j}$. Individual bins are denoted by $p_{-,j}$ and $p_{+,j}$. With this notation in hand, we can write the partitions $J_{-,n}$ and $J_{+,n}$ with equally-spaced bins as $$ p_{-,j} = x_l + j \\times \\frac{\\bar{x}-x_l}{J_{-,n}}$$ and $$p_{+,j} = \\bar{x} + j \\times \\frac{x_u - \\bar{x}}{J_{+,n}}$$ Recreate Figure 3 from Ericson (2014) using $J_{-,n} = J_{+,n} = 10$ and $J_{-,n} = J_{+,n} = 30$ Discuss your results and compare them to your figure in Part 2.

    "##### 4. With the notation above, Calonico, Cattaneo, and Titiunik (2015) derive the optimal number of partitions for an evenly-spaced (ES) RD plot. They show that $$J_{ES, -, n} = [\\frac{V_-}{\\mathbb{V}_{ES,-}} \\frac{n}{\\log(n)^2}]$$ and $$J_{ES, +, n} = [\\frac{V_+}{\\mathbb{V}_{ES,+}} \\frac{n}{\\log(n)^2}]$$ where $V_-$ and $V_+$ denote the sample variance of the subsamples to the left and right of the cutoff and $\\Nu_{ES}$ is an integrated variance term derived in the paper. Use the rdrobust package in R (or Stata or Python) to find the optimal number of bins with an evenly-spaced binning strategy. Report this bin count and recreate your binned scatterplots from parts 2 and 3 based on the optimal bin number."

    "##### 5. One key underlying assumption for RD design is that agents cannot precisely manipulate the running variable. While “precisely” is not very scientific, we can at least test for whether there appears to be a discrete jump in the running variable around the threshold. Evidence of such a jump may suggest that manipulation is present. Provide the results from the manipulation tests described in Cattaneo, Jansson, and Ma (2018). This test can be implemented with the rddensity package in R, Stata, or Python."
