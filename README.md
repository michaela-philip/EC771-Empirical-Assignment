# EC771-Empirical-Assignment
Regression Discontinuity Assignment for EC771 - Spring 2024

Assignment by Professor Ian McCarthy

I use data from Keith Ericson's paper "Consumer Inertia and Firm Pricing in the Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Insurance Exchange" (2014) to utilize regression discontinuity designs.

All results and discussions are in the Jupyter notebook Assignment.ipynb, and one can click 'Run All' to generate graphs, tables, and discussions. The code for each question is housed in the corresponding file in the analysis folder and each file can be run independently. Code to generate graphs is commented out in the analysis scripts to avoid generating two graphs when code is called from the Jupyter notebook.
